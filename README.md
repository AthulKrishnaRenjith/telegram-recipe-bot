# Telegram Recipe Bot Using Machine Learning

> ü•ò Your AI-powered kitchen assistant! Snap a photo or type ingredients‚Äîget personalized recipe recommendations instantly.

## üöÄ Overview

This project is a machine learning-based Telegram bot that intelligently recommends recipes based on user-provided ingredients‚Äîtyped or photographed. Built using a hybrid NLP and computer vision pipeline, the bot aims to promote healthy eating, minimize food waste, and provide a smart shopping assistant.

Developed as part of a Bachelor's capstone project at APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, this system demonstrates practical integration of deep learning, NLP, cloud messaging platforms, and containerized deployment.
